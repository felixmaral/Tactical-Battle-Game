# Tactical Battle Game

A **tactical battle game engine** developed as a personal learning project.  
The project is **complete** and no further development is planned.

## Overview
This repository contains a turn-based tactical battle system designed to explore:
- Unit positioning and movement
- Turn-based combat flow
- Simple ranking and scoring

Originally created for practice, the code now serves as a reference implementation of a basic tactical game engine.

## Features
- Turn-based gameplay with defined phases
- Basic ranking system (`ranking_simple.txt`)
- Modular progression across prototypes (`p0`, `p1`, `p2`)

## Project Structure
├── p0/                  # Initial prototype
├── p1/                  # Intermediate version
├── p2/                  # Final version
├── ranking_simple.txt   # Ranking data
├── .idea/               # IDE configuration
└── .vscode/             # VS Code settings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (adjust if different runtime is used)
- No additional dependencies unless specified

### Run the Game
